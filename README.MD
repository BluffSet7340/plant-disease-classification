# STA401 Plant Disease Classfication Project
---
To meet the requirements of our coursework at the American University of Sharjah, we tasked ourselves with the classificaiton of differrent plant diseases for tomato leaves. We employed a variety of models, from traditional machine learning models to deep learning models. We then performed a comparative analysis between all the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, f1-score, along with the confusion matrix.
